              <p>Working with the author and creator of the survey, <a href="http://www.seemurphy.com/">Carla Murphy</a>, I was the product developer and designer; coding, editing and crafting the interactive report structure and navigation for accessibility and utility. From the data visualizations to the lead illustration, I created the visual experience with an eye towards accessiblity. I also managed user testing, editing and technology coordination with <a href="https://opennews.org/">OpenNews</a>. </p>

            <h4><a href="https://www.mprnews.org/innocence-lost">Innocence Lost</a></h4>
            <p>For Innocence Lost, an award-winning project on the child sexual abuse at the Children's Theatre Company, I managed the story production, art direction, and illustrations. I set up and administered document OCR and analysis in coordination with the team through the reporting process. Working with the reporter and editor team I ensured that the digital and audio experiences met the audiences where they were. </p>
            <p>Due to the sensitive nature of the project, I made sure that documents made available to audiences were handled in accordance with personally identifiable information ethical standards. </p>
            <p>I crafted the illustrations in collaboration with the team, to empathetically amplify the stories of those affected by the abuse. We brainstormed as a team to find a way to make sure that we didn't place vulnerable people in harm's way while conveying the story, and the illustrations were that solution to portray those who were unwilling to be named or depicted in photographs without causing harm. The lead image of the lead story was updated multiple times after survivors allowed the use of their images based on their reactions to the coverage. </p>

            <p>A project on the clergy abuse, cover-up and crisis in the Twin Cities Catholic church. Coordinating with the team I built the story templates and front-end web work, and the infrastructure of the project in addition to ongoing support as new stories came to light. I also performed data analysis and visualization.</p>

            <h4><a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/03/07/graduation-gap-by-the-numbers">Minnesota's Graduation Gap</a></h4>
            <p>Minnesota's failure to graduate its high school students of color is among the worst in the nation. Students who are Native American, black, Hispanic or Asian-American in Minnesota are less likely to graduate on time than their counterparts in nearly every other state in the country. For this project I collaborated with the team to craft a visual theme and format for data visualizations, analyzed the data and crafted the visuals. </p>

            <p>I worked with reporter Solvejg Wastvedt to quantify surge pricing by Uber during Super Bowl. The data was collected via a modified Python application from the Northwestern University Computational Journalism Lab. The idea was based on the assumption that drivers would be able to rake in the cash during the Super Bowl. The reality was quite different. </p>

              <p>A project developed with reporter Solvegj Wastvedt, in concert with the political team, to track the independent expenditures in Minnesota's 2018 congressional races. Independent expeditures allow groups to spend without contribution limits on advertising and other efforts for and against candidates. Utilizing a Python application that polled campaign finance data, normalized it and then updated the microsite for editoral review before updates were published. </p>

            <p>Stories of addiction, loss and recovery amid a public health crisis that has hit epidemic proportions. I worked with the team to analyze data on overdose rates, prescription amounts and various other datasets. I then designed the visuals and an <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/04/18/opioid-overdose-epidemic-explained">animated guide</a> to overdoses and how naloxone may halt an overdose.</p>

            <h4><a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/02/02/climate-change-the-proof">Climate Change in Minnesota</a></h4><p>A century of data proves it: Climate changes have arrived in Minnesota. It's warmer on average, especially in winter, and heavier rain falls in bigger storms. </p>
            <p>The amount of climate data to collect and analyse was immense. I worked with the team to collect and analyze data from the National Climate Assessment, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Minnesota Department of Health and others sources. I analysed the data and created base visuals then worked with a freelance designer who produced the final graphics.</p>

            <h4><a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/groundlevel/">Ground Level</a></h4>
            <p>A testbed for reporting presentation and audience engagement. Everything was focused as mobile friendly, with early attempts finding lightweight browser based presentations to entice audiences to engage with the reporting. Working with editor Dave Peters and various reporters, we were able to experiment with varied technologies and techniques to bridge the gap with audiences. I coordinated with various freelance photographers as I coded the web presentations, performed data analysis and created the data visualizations.</p>


            <h4>Ground Level - <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/groundlevel/fighting-for-an-american-countryside/home.html">Fighting for an American Countryside</a></h4>
            <p>People in rural Minnesota are battling small-town decline with determination, resourceful thinking, and unwavering belief.</p>
            <p>A multi-avenue presentation from the Ground Level project that meets the audience where they are. For Fighting for an American Countryside, on how rural communities faced a changing world, I was the producer, product manager, data journalist and web developer, among other roles. I coded the multi-platform presentation with an eye for the future. This work was a foundation for the Betrayed by Silence project infrastructure.</p>

            
            <h4>Ground Level - <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/projects/2014/01/ground-level-beneath-the-surface/">Beneath the Surface</a></h4>
            <p>This Ground Level project, "Beneath the Surface," shines a light on the pressures on Minnesota’s groundwater and how residents, businesses and officials are being asked to adapt. I coded the presentation, produced the stories, coordinated with the freelance photographers, and provided data analysis and visuals. </p>
