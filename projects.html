            <h4><a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/catholic-church/">Betrayed by Silence</a></h4>
            <p>A project on the clergy abuse, cover-up and crisis in the Twin Cities Catholic church. Coordinating with the team I built the story templates and front-end web work, and the infrastructure of the project in addition to ongoing support as new stories came to light. I also performed data analysis and visualization.</p>

            <h4><a href="http://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/03/07/graduation-gap-by-the-numbers">Minnesota's Graduation Gap</a></h4>
            <p>Minnesota's failure to graduate its high school students of color is among the worst in the nation. Students who are Native American, black, Hispanic or Asian-American in Minnesota are less likely to graduate on time than their counterparts in nearly every other state in the country. For this project I collaborated with the team to craft a visual theme and format for data visualizations, analyzed the data and crafted the visuals. </p>

            <p>A testbed for reporting presentation and audience engagement. Everything was focused as mobile friendly, with early attempts finding lightweight browser based presentations to entice audiences to engage with the reporting. Working with editor Dave Peters and various reporters, we were able to experiment with varied technologies and techniques to bridge the gap with audiences. </p>

            A multi-avenue presentation from the Ground Level project that meets the audience where they are. For Fighting for an American Countryside, on how rural communities faced a changing world, I was the producer, product manager, data journalist and web developer, among other roles. I coded the multi-platform presentation with an eye for the future. This work was a foundation for the Betrayed by Silence project infrastructure.</p>

            <p>I worked with reporter Solvejg Wastvedt to quantify surge pricing by Uber during Super Bowl. The data was collected via a modified Python application from the Northwestern University Computational Journalism Lab.
