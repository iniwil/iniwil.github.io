            <p>These projects span the spectrum of magnitude and roles, ranging from small collaborative works to large team productions. My roles included product and project management, art direction and group facilitation combined with content creation, from illustrations, data analysis and visualizations. Each utilized my skills and experience to provide a synthesis of content, collaboration and delivery systems to build bridges connecting with audiences. </p>
            <p>For each of the projects they followed an ethical framework utilizing best practices for the handling of data, both internally and in journalism products. I also created <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iVAXsGZJS2KRXah1dabUG54YaqJFmRXVGVQSyG2hB-Q/edit?usp=sharing">style guides</a> for visual presentation at MPR News. </p>
            <p>I approach each project from the standpoint that data represents people, either their lives or what affects their lives, and data should be treated accordingly. Often data is used for reporting, it informs and shapes it, but isn't released in a raw format. The interpretation of that data is where the visuals come in. Sometimes for a simple chart a platform like Datawrapper or Flourish is used, for others an illustration or something handcrafted is more engaging and appropriate for audiences. </p>
            <p>In the MPR News room I was the data resource, often assisting reporters with data collection, cleaning and other tasks. My data work ranged from the gargantuan datasets of climate change to small handcrafted databases of rural hospital closures to tracking '1033 Program' federal distributions of military hardware to police and many others between. </p>
            <p>At MPR News, datavis was credited as the graphic paired with a story under a radio reporter byline. Due to this legacy news organization choice many data works show credit on visualizations, but not bylines. Examples of this may be found <a href="./charts.html">here</a>. </p>
            <p>Amid these long term projects, I built frameworks for quick turn <a href="./charts.html">explainers</a>, <a href="./maps.html">maps</a>, and <a href="./visuals.html">illustrations</a> to take the complex and make it relevant, interesting and engaging no matter what platform the audience chooses. I also wrote many stories under <a href="./bylines.html">my own byline</a>. Each work built upon its predecessors and served to normalize the use of engaging storytelling as audiences were increasingly engaged on visual platforms. </p>

            <p>A verbose list of my skills may be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Svvj-gCZLErbgwQgRiMM0wqbPcIy7KjbCaiau0l6lvs/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

              <p>Working with the author and creator of the survey, <a href="http://www.seemurphy.com/">Carla Murphy</a>, I was the product developer and designer; coding, editing and crafting the interactive report structure and navigation for accessibility and utility. From the data visualizations to the lead illustration, I created the visual experience with an eye towards accessiblity.

              <p>For Innocence Lost, an <a href="./awards.html">award-winning</a> project on the child sexual abuse at the Children's Theatre Company, I managed the story production, art direction, and illustrations. I set up and administered document OCR and analysis in coordination with the team through the reporting process. Working with the reporter and editor team I ensured that the digital and audio experiences met the audiences where they were.</p>
              <p>Due to the sensitive nature of the project, data and documents made available to audiences were handled in accordance with personally identifiable information ethical standards.</p>
              <p>I crafted the illustrations in collaboration with the team, to empathetically amplify the stories of those affected by the abuse. We brainstormed as a team to find a way to make sure that we didn't place vulnerable people in harm's way while conveying the story, and the illustrations were that solution to portray those who were unwilling to be named or depicted in photographs without causing harm. The lead image of the lead story was updated multiple times after more survivors allowed the use of their images based on their reactions to the coverage.</p>
              <p>The visuals were crafted with social media engagement in mind, various versions of visual elements were crafted to maintain a consistent multiplatform campaign. Examples may be seen on Twitter(<a href="https://twitter.com/MPRnews/status/1189294587006709760">here</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=mpr%20news%20innocence%20lost&src=typed_query">here</a>) and Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3VVk_hlX7W/?igshid=7ddj2gofzp6y">here</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3u3HVAFYzc/?igshid=pfduv1nw86va">here</a>). </p>

                <p>Minnesota's failure to graduate its high school students of color is among the worst in the nation. Students who are Native American, black, Hispanic or Asian-American in Minnesota are less likely to graduate on time than their counterparts in nearly every other state in the country. For this project, I collaborated with the team to craft a visual theme and format for data visualizations, analyzed the data and crafted the visuals. The data was gathered from state agencies and schools and was analyzed in various tools, cleaned and normalized. Paired with extensive reporting the data provided context and common threads among stories told.</p>

            <p>I worked with reporter Solvejg Wastvedt to quantify surge pricing by Uber during Super Bowl. The data was collected via a modified Python application from the Northwestern University Computational Journalism Lab. The idea was based on the assumption that drivers would be able to rake in the cash during the Super Bowl. The reality was quite different. </p>
            <p>We polled Uber date via one of their api endpoints to create our own dataset. We used <a href="https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/b8223b348224ac59c3dcb4829abeb1c1/super-bowl-uber-surge/index.html">Knight Labs Storymap</a> for guiding audiences through notable points of reporting.</p>

              <p>A project developed with reporter Solvejg Wastvedt, in concert with the political team, to track the independent expenditures in Minnesota's 2018 congressional races. Independent expeditures allow groups to spend without contribution limits on advertising and other efforts for and against candidates. Utilizing a Python application that polled campaign finance data, normalized it and then updated the microsite for editoral review before updates were published. </p>
