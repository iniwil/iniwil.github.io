                  <h3>Leavers Methodology</h3>
                      <p>Leavers is a 44-question online-only survey that opened for responses February 19-March 9, 2020. A "Leaver" was defined in the survey description to respondents as someone who had, "left the occupation after any period of time, for any reason, including those who moved into non-journalist occupations within the journalism industry." </p>
                      
                    <h4>Recruiting</h4>
                      <p>This project recruited respondents using the snowball sampling method, along with targeted, sometimes repeat outreach to the affinity organizations&mdash;NAJA, NLGJA, JAWS, NAHJ, AAJA, SAJA, NABJ, and AMEJA&mdash;who then shared a form letter invitation to participate in the survey. (Outreach to AMEJA started later than the other affinity groups; I wasn’t aware of its existence when the survey went public) The survey was initially shared through Carla Murphy’s private accounts via Facebook, Twitter, JOC slack (in relevant channels), and LinkedIn. On request, JOC influencers (i.e. Nikole Hannah-Jones at the New York Times, Arun Venugopal at WNYC, Gustavo Arellano at the LA Times) spread the word to their communities, typically via RTs on Twitter or e-mail. </p>
                      <p>SQ44, the last (and optional) question on the survey, asked respondents to suggest former JOCs by adding their e-mail addresses. Twelve (12) respondents entered e-mail addresses. The survey was sent to all 12. None of those e-mail addresses took the survey.</p>
                      <p>Altogether the survey was directly shared to about 60 individuals (representing various racial/ethnic communities in journalism, foundations, academia, and communications) and group lists, including: Labor communicators listserv; pcdc listserv; What’s Your Plan B? FB page; Life after Journalism FB page; etc. (Will share full list on request)</p>
                    <h4>Respondents</h4>
                      <p>n= 101. There were 102 respondents, but during data cleaning it was discovered that one respondent was still in journalism. That response was excluded from analysis.</p>
                    <h4>Questions</h4>
                      <p>For ease of analysis, most questions were quantitative and excluding write-ins for zip codes or email address, for example, 5 were substantively qualitative (see below).</p>
                      <p>The "Pathways II: Just after leaving" section was excluded from this analysis. Due to unclear question sequencing, respondents misunderstood three of the four questions in the section.</p>
                      <p>The manager’s question is SQ25, "Your last role as a journalist included managerial duties, i.e. responsible for junior staff or freelancer outcomes."It is worded to focus on duties, not a manager’s title, in recognition of a common practice within the industry of assigning job titles that may not communicate the responsibility of the workers’ duties.</p>
                      <p>The career stages question is SQ29. It is written to allow respondents to self-determine their own career stages and select one of five options: entry level; on the cusp of mid-career; mid-career; on the cusp of senior level; senior level. </p>
                      <p>Questions were often duplicated to act as internal checks on responses (for example, to triangulate reasons for "leaving"). </p>
                      <p>Before finalization, survey questions went through at least three iterations with a select group of reviewers that included current journalists and media communication researchers.</p>
                    <h4>Leavers’ qualitative questions</h4>
                      <p>SQ15: If you answered "yes" [to still thinking of yourself as a journalist] please share your reason why.</p>
                      <p>SQ22: If your view of journalism changed from beginning to end, please share your reasons why.</p>
                      <p>SQ36: At the time, what, if anything would have stopped you from leaving your occupation as a journalist? [respondents were given the option to mark "private" if the answer related to family, illness, etc]</p>
                      <p>SQ41: Name a forward-thinking package, project, innovation, convening or person to come out of a newsroom/the industry in the past few years.</p>
                      <p>SQ42: What is the one word that best describes your work experience within newsrooms or the industry?</p>

                    <h4>Strengths and Weaknesses of the Leavers project</h4>
                      <p>The strength of Leavers is the breadth of experience, time spent in the industry, and the race/ethnic diversity captured by the sample. Another strength is the identity, background and track record on race and class of the person running the survey. This, along with the survey’s knowledge of the journalism career pipeline, may’ve encouraged respondents to fully and candidly reply to the qualitative questions.</p>
                      <p>The weakness of Leavers, a survey of work experiences, is that it captures neither income nor wealth information. Those questions were excluded, it was initially thought, to increase the likelihood that former JOCs would take and finish an online survey run by an individual and not an institution. Another weakness is that the "Pathways II: Just after leaving" section was excluded from analysis. This section captured key employment status information (including unemployment and under-employment and length of time) for the period immediately after leaving journalism.</p>
