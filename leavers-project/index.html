                    <p class="quote-text">"It’s tough being a black woman in television news. If you’re a serious journalist you’re perceived as “angry.” I was once told I didn’t smile enough. If you advocated for a different angle in storytelling you were often dismissed. Corrected a millennial, you were intimidating. That coupled with how social media changed how we covered news left me burnt out and depressed. Had I not felt that way day in and day out in good of the daily stress that comes from working in TV news I may have stayed."</p>

                    <p>It is striking that more than one-third of 'Leavers' say they had managerial duties at the time they left journalism. Most (25) left journalism between 2016-2020, and most (27) say they left journalism at or after their mid-career point (see below). Leaver managers are ages 27-44 and more non-Black than the overall sample. Of 19 total male respondents, 9 say they had managerial duties at the time they left journalism.</p>

                    <h3>Leavers Methodology</h3>
                    <p>'Leavers' is a 44-question online-only survey of former journalists of color that opened for responses February 19-March 9, 2020. A “Leaver” was defined to respondents as someone who had, “left the occupation after any period of time, for any reason, including those who moved into non-journalist occupations within the journalism industry.” <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XO_DlSmU8qORUL6JDMTS4LaTg-6BZEKV/view?usp=sharing">View the Survey questions</a>. </p>
                    <h4>Recruiting</h4>
                    <p>This project recruited respondents using the snowball sampling method, along with targeted, repeat outreach to the affinity organizations&mdash;NAJA, NLGJA, JAWS, NAHJ, AAJA, SAJA, NABJ, and AMEJA&mdash; some of whom then shared a form letter invitation with their members. (Outreach to AMEJA started later than the other affinity groups; I wasn’t aware of its existence when the survey went live) The survey was initially shared through Carla Murphy’s private accounts via Facebook, Twitter, JOC slack (in relevant channels), and LinkedIn. On request, JOC influencers (i.e. Nikole Hannah-Jones at the New York Times, Arun Venugopal at WNYC, Gustavo Arellano at the L.A. Times) spread the word to their communities, typically via RTs on Twitter or e-mail. </p>
                    <p>SQ44, the last (and optional) question on the survey, asked respondents to suggest former JOCs by adding their e-mail addresses. Twelve (12) respondents entered e-mail addresses. The survey was sent to all 12. None of those e-mail addresses took the survey.
                    <p>Altogether the survey was directly shared to about 60 individuals (representing various racial/ethnic communities in journalism, foundations, academia, and communications) and group lists, including: Labor communicators listserv; pcdc listserv; the ‘What’s Your Plan B?’ FB page; ‘Life after Journalism’ FB page; etc. (Will share full list on request)</p>
                    <p>Given resource limitations, this project did not seek to recruit a representative sample of JOCs in the industry.</p>
                    <h4>Respondents</h4>
                    <p>n=101. There were 102 survey respondents, but during data cleaning it was discovered that one respondent was still in journalism. That response was excluded from analysis.</p>
                    <h4>Questions</h4>
                    <p>For ease of analysis most questions were quantitative, and excluding write-ins for zip code or e-mail address, for example, 5 were substantively qualitative (see below). Questions were also: multiple choice, limited response, ranking order, and multiple checkbox.</p>
                    <p>The “Pathways II: Just after leaving” section was excluded from this analysis. Due to unclear question sequencing, some respondents incorrectly sequenced three of the four questions in the section.</p>
                    <p>The manager’s question is SQ25, “Your last role as a journalist included managerial duties, i.e. responsible for junior staff or freelancer outcomes.” It is worded to focus on duties, not a manager’s title, in recognition of a common practice within the industry of assigning job titles that may not communicate the worker’s duties.</p>
                    <p>The career stages question is SQ29. It is written to allow respondents to self-determine their own stage and select one of five options: entry level; on the cusp of mid-career; mid-career; on the cusp of senior level; senior level. </p>
                    <p>Questions were often duplicated to act as internal checks on responses (for example, to triangulate reasons for “leaving”). </p>
                    <p>Before they were finalized, survey questions went through at least three iterations with a select group of reviewers that included current journalists and media communication researchers.</p>
                    <h4>Qualitative questions</h4>
                    <p>Respondents’ answers were coded by dominant themes. Every effort was made to avoid inference; statements with unclear or questionable meaning were excluded from the analysis. A PhD candidate in a field unrelated to journalism was sub-contracted to read behind me and fact-check that my takeaways accurately represented the responses. The non-journalism perspective was important, as she was most struck by repeat descriptions of toxic work environments and labor exploitation and concerns regarding mental health and well being. Her coding and impressions made me realize that I’d somewhat ‘normalized’ exploitation and high levels of stress. I explain this via the following: I came up in journalism when its business model had already started to fail, and I’ve spent the bulk of my career in the industry’s “outer-ring,” i.e. as a communities journalist, as a freelancer, or seeking to report stories for non-white audiences. This outer-ring, like newer Digital-only properties, may be more vulnerable to abusive practices.</p>
                    <h4>'Leavers'’ qualitative questions</h4>
                    <p>SQ15: If you answered “yes” [to still identifying and thinking of yourself as a journalist] please share your reason why.</p>
                    <p>SQ22: If your view of journalism changed from beginning to end, please share your reasons why.</p>
                    <p>SQ36: At the time, what, if anything would have stopped you from leaving your occupation as a journalist? [respondents were given the option to mark “private” if the answer related to family, illness, etc]</p>
                    <p>SQ41: Name a forward-thinking package, project, innovation, convening or person to come out of a newsroom/the industry in the past few years.</p>
                    <p>SQ42: What is the one word that best describes your work experience within newsrooms or the industry?</p>
                    <h4>Raw Data</h4>
                    <p>Survey respondents were told that, “All identifying information will be anonymized; e-mail addresses are for this project's work, only, and will not be shared.” During cleaning, analysis, write-up and Web design, raw data was stored on computer harddrives and a shared Google Drive. At project’s end, i.e. on publication of results, all project data will be transferred to long-term secure storage.</p>
                    <h4>Strengths and Weaknesses</h4>
                    <p>The strength of 'Leavers' is the breadth of experience, time spent in the industry, and the race/ethnic diversity captured by the sample. I’d set out to test whether 'Leavers' left journalism at mid-career, and this was corroborated. Another strength was that survey design enabled respondents to self-identify their race/ethnic identities, choose not to say or write-in a response. The descriptor, “of color,” is a U.S.-centric term. Given that, I extended invitations to all race/ethnic affinity groups with the expectation that some members would not view themselves as, “of color.” When questioned if this survey considered an individual “of color”, it was explained that the decision was theirs. A corollary strength, then, is the surveyor’s identity, background and track record on interpreting race, class and immigration/diaspora issues. This, along with a demonstrated understanding of the diversity of race/ethnic identities and the contours of the journalism career path, may’ve encouraged respondents to fully and candidly reply to the qualitative questions. </p>
                    <p>The weakness of 'Leavers', a survey of work experience, is that it captures neither income nor wealth information. Those questions were excluded, it was initially thought, to increase the likelihood that former JOCs would take and finish an online survey run by an individual and not an institution. Another weakness is that while the survey initially set out to understand JOC pathways and employment status immediately after leaving, the “Pathways II: Just after leaving,” section had to be excluded from analysis.</p>
