  Radio version of tabs.

  Requirements:
  - not rely on specific IDs for CSS (the CSS shouldn't need to know specific IDs)
  - flexible for any number of unkown tabs [2-6]
  - accessible

  Caveats:
  - since these are checkboxes the tabs not tab-able, need to use arrow keys

          <!-- <h2>A guide to better hiring practices</h2> -->
              <p>Newsroom leaders, hiring managers and job candidates agree: the journalism hiring process is fraught right now, especially in local news.</p>
              <p>Leaders and managers are under pressure to make smart hires under tight budgets, quick timelines and an industry in flux. Early-career candidates must navigate uncertainty along with their need to gain experience, learn new skills and earn a living wage. Everyone is concerned with newsroom culture, diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging and working conditions in a time of increased burnout and turnover.</p>
              <p>The Better Practices Playbook is an effort to gather the wisdom of dozens of smart folks in the industry and share it in an easily accessible format.</p>
              <p class="underlined">We have a few goals with this project:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Compiling better — not best, as this work is constantly evolving — hiring practices from a diverse, thoughtful group of professionals across the local news space who are often bringing folks into local news</li>
                <li>Highlighting some of the folks and organizations pioneering this work</li>
                <li>Creating an accessible, public standard in order to create accountability</li>

              </ul>
              <p>Though early-career journalists are often college students or recent graduates, <a href="https://www.cislm.org/how-journalism-training-programs-across-the-nation-are-empowering-and-nurturing-homegrown-talent/">they don’t have to be</a> — we intentionally use the term early-career journalists in this guide to represent anyone entering the field.</p>
              <p>This playbook is the culmination of our findings and will live as a free and living document that shares the best practices and knowledge shared with us during the project.</p>
              <p>A big thank you to our team of undergraduate interns who worked on this project over the course of 2022-2023:</p>

      <h2>For applicants</h2>
      <div class="hiring-intro">
          <p>Especially when experiencing a big life transition, it's true that there are a lot of internal (and often external!) pressures early career journalists face. Don't feel that you're going into this job search blind, and don't feel like there's no one on your side.</p>
          <p>And don't feel like if you don't get the job or internship you wanted immediately that you're failing.</p>
          <p>"When I was 28, I was working in a surf shop," <a href="https://journalism.calpoly.edu/faculty/brady-teufel">Brady Teufel</a>, journalism department chair at CAL Poly and student advisor at Mustang News, said. "It's all going to work out."</p>
          <p>It's also OK to find a job that will pay you what you need to survive. Unlike what the greeting cards say, passion is not priceless — there's no shame in taking a job in, local news or otherwise, that helps you meet your needs.</p>
          <p>To summarize this section, most hiring managers want to see is an effort for the role — did you show up on time? Did you care enough to research what the organization does? Did you make an effort in your appearance? Have you thought about where you might fit into this organization?</p>
          <h2>The most common advice from all we talked to is:<br> Be a journalist. Do your research about what you're walking into, and how you can help.</h2>

              <h2>“Is this where you want to be?” </h2>
              <p class="lead-quote">🗣️ “My general advice (for early career journalists) would be to look for jobs where they would get good editing, where there would be an investment in their continued improvement.” — Erica Perel, CISLM director and former general manager of The Daily Tar Heel </p>

              <p>What skills would you like to develop, either personally or professionally? Your first post-graduation internship or job likely won’t be a star-studded experience. But it should be a place where your curiosity is encouraged. </p>

              <p>“Go somewhere where you’ll learn something,” Teufel said. That could be how to be a leader from a great manager; that could be how to report on the business beat; it could be how to get a community you’re new in to trust your reporting. </p>

              <p>When evaluating internships, look at the experiences of past interns and fellows, said Lauren Mack, former associate director of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University. What are their current roles, where did they end up after completing the program and how many were hired post-grad? Are those benchmarks where you want to be? </p>

              <p>“(Working in local news) is an opportunity to make a difference in a place, and to also grow professionally,” said Emily Hughes Corio, journalism & media program chair, teaching professor and internship coordinator at West Virginia University.</p>

              <p>Different jobs provide different learning opportunities. For example, aggregation reporting roles where you write three stories a day mean less face time with sources but could shore up your ability to write quickly on tight deadlines, said Lila Carney, director of career development for the School of Communications at Quinnipiac University.</p>

              <p>At more established legacy media outlets, you'll likely be working within a pre-existing structure, workflow and expectations. Working for independent or nonprofit journalism outlets will likely give you more freedom to try new things but also less support.</p>

              <p>And in terms of financial or organizational sustainability, consider the media landscape where your desired organization sits. For example, in broadcast markets, the station’s ranking impact its bottom line, notes Kelly Barnett, assistant director, people and culture, for Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.</p>

              <p>Before embarking on this journey, like most journeys’ beginnings, it’s worth it to spend some extra time here to be intentional with your efforts.</p>

              <p class="lead-quote">🗣️ “What I tell people is it's not usually the organization. It's the people you work with that can make or break a job.” — Pam Garcia-Rivera, Media, Information and Communication career advisor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s School of Journalism and Mass Communication</p>
              <p>It’s important to remember that hiring managers need great local journalists as much as you need a job — maybe even more so.</p>
              <p>Many, but not all, career services representatives surveyed for this report said fewer than half of their students are taking paid jobs in local news, preferring other kinds of media jobs. This means a qualified and passionate local news reporter will stand out to hiring managers, who have a real need to move fast to fill their openings.</p>
              <p>That’s not to say you shouldn’t put your best foot forward or show up without preparing.</p>
              <p><a href="https://hbr.org/2022/01/youre-not-an-imposter-youre-actually-pretty-amazing">Brush off your imposter syndrome</a>, celebrate your wins and keep an open mind — local news outlets are lucky to have you and they will certainly utilize you. You’ll be jumping into a hands-on experience on day one, working alongside and learning from folks who are experts in the field. And trade that <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/do-you-have-a-scarcity-mindset-or-an-abundance-mindset/">scarcity mindset</a> for one of abundance – a ton of research shows it’s better for you in the long run. </p>

              <p class="lead-quote">🗣️  “Be open to new beats; diversify your skillset.” — Lauren Mack, freelance journalist & former associate director of the Graduate School of Journalism, Columbia University</p>
              <p>Be open to learning new things you didn’t expect. </p>

              <p>In local news, there’s always an opportunity to learn something new, from reporting to editing to visual journalism to data science and production. </p>

              <p>If you’re traditionally a sports reporter, you can expand those data reporting and feature writing skills by taking a job covering healthcare; if you covered local government, why not try the production and analytics side?</p>

              <p>For folks graduating from college specifically, don’t hesitate to consider an internship as the path to enter the field.</p>

              <p>“Don't count out a post-grad internship, especially if you don't have much experience,” said Pam Garcia-Rivera, Media, Information and Communication career advisor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s School of Journalism and Mass Communication. </p>

                <h2>Listings, Applying & Interviewing</h2>
              
              <p>So you’ve thought through what you might be looking for — congratulations! Let’s chat more about some good things to look for in listings, the application process, the interviews and more. 
              </p>

            <button class="accordion">Listing: What is the salary? If it’s not listed, are they transparent about why?
            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p class="lead-quote">🗣️ “I can't predict the future, but (orgs that offer unpaid internships) are going to continue to struggle, and the quality of the employee is going to suffer.” — Lila Carney, director of career development, Quinnipiac University School of Communications </p>
              <p>A key better practice is salary transparency. The job listing should include a pay range or minimum salary. This helps candidates reserve a major resource in the searching process, time, if the salary isn’t able to meet their living needs.</p>
              <p>And if you are interested in a job listing without a salary, make sure you ask about it early. 
              The Chatham News + Record in North Carolina doesn’t advertise the salary in job listings, but they also don’t hide it, said Bill Horner III, until recently the co-owner and publisher of the small newspaper. He’s participated in panels on mentorship such as <a href="https://nclocalnewsworkshop.org/programs/2022-nc-local-news-and-information-summit/">The Care and Feeding of Early-Career Journalists</a> at the NC Local News Summit in 2022. </p>
              <p>He said they don’t advertise the salary in postings because they don’t want to deter candidates from the initial interview, but make it a point to be very open about what the outlet can afford to pay during the interview. </p>
              <p>“It’s not that we don’t want to (pay more), it’s that our budgeted pay rate is what we can afford to pay,” Horner said. “We’re a small organization. What our reporters do get is a lot of flexibility and freedom to really stretch their legs creatively, which translates into a phenomenal early-career experience. I also like to share with prospects a list of organizations where my former reporters are working — The New York Times, The State in Columbia, The News & Observer… That always piques (candidates’) interest, knowing we’re on the radar of other news organizations.”</p>
              <p>“If the pay is low, what are the other benefits?” Garcia-Rivera said. “What does that look like, because it can really be a big motive, that could add a lot more.”</p>

          <button class="accordion">Listing: Watch out for kitchen sink jobs</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p class="lead-quote">🗣️ 🗣️ “One of my critiques of hiring at news organizations is lengthy job descriptions that aren't clearly defined. They're posted publicly and include a laundry list of responsibilities and tasks.” — Catherine Komp, independent journalist and editor; co-presenter at NC Local News Summit on "How to overcome roadblocks to a more equitable workplace"</p>

              <p>A job listing with the responsibilities of three-plus roles could be a sign of poor organizational structure, said Lisa Heyamoto, programming director, membership education, at LION Publishers.</p>

              <p>LION defines sustainability as the intersection of operational resilience, financial health and journalistic impact.  </p>

              <p>“Operational resilience: Without a company culture and systems, processes and policies designed to support staff and manage growth, news businesses will experience burnout among the very people whose talent and buy-in are critical to their success,” the definition states.</p>

              <p>Absolutely feel free to explore and try new things and push your comfort limit, but be sure to ask detailed questions about jobs with varied responsibilities. </p>

              <p>The best internships or early career experiences provide you with a mentor to show you the ropes, or otherwise set you up for success.</p>
              <p>Some questions to consider during your internship interview, if they aren’t already addressed:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>How does the company invest in interns or in early-career journalists, in terms of time and money? Both are valuable resources! </li>

          <p>Hiring managers in local news: You’re likely wearing a lot of hats and doing a lot with very little. We know you’re likely juggling leadership at work and caretaking at home, on top of taking care of yourself. And quite often, especially in tight operations, we know that hiring can often feel like an act of triage to resolve the chaos of being understaffed.</p>

          <p>We hope that these tips and resources can be helpful to you as you work to build your team, especially to help you find the right fit. </p>

          <p>And if you don’t have the bandwidth or the capacity to do this work right now, there are a handful of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vmFlUi9rt-cf2dI2kkXC2-TrNgd5fp28P4WohG0Virg/edit#heading=h.crurv9n2a7qv">incredible consultants for hire</a> who are quite literally studying and creating some of these better practices. </p>

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      

        <p>In order to get a sense of better practices in hiring across local news, we created a list of professionals in four categories — recruiting, student media, talent development and career services. </p>

        <p>We knew we wanted a larger sample size for these interviews, with multiple folks conducting these interviews using standardized questions. </p>

        <p>We looked for professionals doing work in fellowships in well-known places such as Reynolds Journalism Institute, JSK Fellowships, Nieman Fellowships and more. We searched industry publications archives in Nieman Labs and Columbia Journalism Review to find more. </p>

        <p>For less widely publicized roles such as career services counselors, we looked first for professionals who worked in journalism-specific schools rather than in a general career services role. We wanted the widest possible variety in experiences, reaching out to folks in community colleges, historically Black colleges and universities, public four-year and private universities. </p>

        <p>For recruiters, we tried to get a variety of sources from both corporate-led and more independent news organizations, including folks who are now teaching after years of recruitment. We also tried to diversify perspectives on recruitment by media type.</p>

        <p>For talent development professionals, we reached out to folks who are leading fellowship and internship programs that bring early career journalists into the field, or folks who are creating content that informs early career journalists on how to enter the field.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, for the first round of interviews, we found that folks closer to our networks were more likely to respond, hence the large proportion of respondents from NC and the Southeast. We hope to further expand this network in future rounds of reporting. </p>
