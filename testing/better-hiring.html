  Radio version of tabs.

  Requirements:
  - not rely on specific IDs for CSS (the CSS shouldn't need to know specific IDs)
  - flexible for any number of unkown tabs [2-6]
  - accessible

  Caveats:
  - since these are checkboxes the tabs not tab-able, need to use arrow keys

  Also worth reading:

              <p>Newsroom leaders, hiring managers and job candidates agree: the journalism hiring process is fraught right now, especially in local news.</p>
              <p>Leaders and managers are under pressure to make smart hires under tight budgets, quick timelines and an industry in flux. Early-career candidates must navigate uncertainty along with their need to gain experience, learn new skills and earn a living wage. Everyone is concerned with newsroom culture, diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging and working conditions in a time of increased burnout and turnover.</p>

                  <li><p>Highlighting some of the folks and organizations pioneering this work</p></li>
                  <li><p>Creating an accessible, public standard in order to create accountability</p></li>

              <p>Though early-career journalists are often college students or recent graduates, <a href="https://www.cislm.org/how-journalism-training-programs-across-the-nation-are-empowering-and-nurturing-homegrown-talent/">they don’t have to be</a> — we intentionally use the term early-career journalists in this guide to represent anyone entering the field.</p>
              <p>This playbook is the culmination of our findings and will live as a free and living document that shares the best practices and knowledge shared with us during the project.</p>

          <p>Especially when experiencing a big life transition, it's true that there are a lot of internal (and often external!) pressures early career journalists face. Don't feel that you're going into this job search blind, and don't feel like there's no one on your side.</p>
          <p>And don't feel like if you don't get the job or internship you wanted immediately that you're failing.</p>
          <p>"When I was 28, I was working in a surf shop," <a href="https://journalism.calpoly.edu/faculty/brady-teufel">Brady Teufel</a>, journalism department chair at CAL Poly and student advisor at Mustang News, said. "It's all going to work out."</p>
          <p>It's also OK to find a job that will pay you what you need to survive. Unlike what the greeting cards say, passion is not priceless — there's no shame in taking a job in, local news or otherwise, that helps you meet your needs.</p>
          <p>To summarize this section, most hiring managers want to see is an effort for the role — did you show up on time? Did you care enough to research what the organization does? Did you make an effort in your appearance? Have you thought about where you might fit into this organization?</p>
        <div class="goals">
          <h2>The most common advice from all we talked to is:</h2> <h2>Be a journalist. Do your research about what you're walking into, and how you can help.</h2>

              <p>What skills would you like to develop, either personally or professionally? Your first post-graduation internship or job likely won’t be a star-studded experience. But it should be a place where your curiosity is encouraged. </p>

              <p>“Go somewhere where you’ll learn something,” Teufel said. That could be how to be a leader from a great manager; that could be how to report on the business beat; it could be how to get a community you’re new in to trust your reporting. </p>

              <p>When evaluating internships, look at the experiences of past interns and fellows. What are their current roles, where did they end up after completing the program and how many were hired post-grad? Are those benchmarks where you want to be?</p>

              <p>“(Working in local news) is an opportunity to make a difference in a place, and to also grow professionally,” said Emily Hughes Corio, journalism & media program chair, teaching professor and internship coordinator at West Virginia University.</p>

              <p>Different jobs provide different learning opportunities. For example, aggregation reporting roles where you write three stories a day mean less face time with sources but could shore up your ability to write quickly on tight deadlines, said Lila Carney, director of career development for the School of Communications at Quinnipiac University.</p>

              <p>At more established legacy media outlets, you'll likely be working within a pre-existing structure, workflow and expectations. Working for independent or nonprofit journalism outlets will likely give you more freedom to try new things but also less support.</p>

              <p>And in terms of financial or organizational sustainability, consider the media landscape where your desired organization sits. For example, in broadcast markets, the station’s ranking impact its bottom line, notes Kelly Barnett, assistant director, people and culture, for Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.</p>

              <p>Before embarking on this journey, like most journeys’ beginnings, it’s worth it to spend some extra time here to be intentional with your efforts.</p>

              <p>It’s important to remember that hiring managers need great local journalists as much as you need a job — maybe even more so.</p>
              <p>Many, but not all, career services representatives surveyed for this report said fewer than half of their students are taking paid jobs in local news, preferring other kinds of media jobs. This means a qualified and passionate local news reporter will stand out to hiring managers, who have a real need to move fast to fill their openings.</p>

              <p>If you’re traditionally a sports reporter, you can expand those data reporting and feature writing skills by taking a job covering healthcare; if you covered local government, why not try the production and analytics side?</p>

              <p>For folks graduating from college specifically, don’t hesitate to consider an internship as the path to enter the field.</p>

              <p>“Don't count out a post-grad internship, especially if you don't have much experience,” said Pam Garcia-Rivera, Media, Information and Communication career advisor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s School of Journalism and Mass Communication. </p>

              <p>So you’ve thought through what you might be looking for — congratulations! Let’s chat more about some good things to look for in listings, the application process, the interviews and more. 
              </p>

            <button class="accordion">Listing: What is the salary? If it’s not listed, are they transparent about why?
            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p class="lead-quote">🗣️ “I can't predict the future, but (orgs that offer unpaid internships) are going to continue to struggle, and the quality of the employee is going to suffer.”</p><p> — Lila Carney, director of career development, Quinnipiac University School of Communications </p>
              <p>A key better practice is salary transparency. The job listing should include a pay range or minimum salary. This helps candidates reserve a major resource in the searching process, time, if the salary isn’t able to meet their living needs.</p>
              <p>And if you are interested in a job listing without a salary, make sure you ask about it early. 
              The Chatham News + Record in North Carolina doesn’t advertise the salary in job listings, but they also don’t hide it, said Bill Horner III, until recently the co-owner and publisher of the small newspaper. He’s participated in panels on mentorship such as <a href="https://nclocalnewsworkshop.org/programs/2022-nc-local-news-and-information-summit/">The Care and Feeding of Early-Career Journalists</a> at the NC Local News Summit in 2022. </p>
              <p>He said they don’t advertise the salary in postings because they don’t want to deter candidates from the initial interview, but make it a point to be very open about what the outlet can afford to pay during the interview. </p>
              <p>“It’s not that we don’t want to (pay more), it’s that our budgeted pay rate is what we can afford to pay,” Horner said. “We’re a small organization. What our reporters do get is a lot of flexibility and freedom to really stretch their legs creatively, which translates into a phenomenal early-career experience. I also like to share with prospects a list of organizations where my former reporters are working — The New York Times, The State in Columbia, The News & Observer… That always piques (candidates’) interest, knowing we’re on the radar of other news organizations.”</p>
              <p>“If the pay is low, what are the other benefits?” Garcia-Rivera said. “What does that look like, because it can really be a big motive, that could add a lot more.”</p>

              <p class="lead-quote">🗣️ “One of my critiques of hiring at news organizations is lengthy job descriptions that aren't clearly defined. They're posted publicly and include a laundry list of responsibilities and tasks.”</p><p> — Catherine Komp, independent journalist and editor; co-presenter at NC Local News Summit on "How to overcome roadblocks to a more equitable workplace"</p>

              <p>A job listing with the responsibilities of three-plus roles could be a sign of poor organizational structure, said Lisa Heyamoto, programming director, membership education, at LION Publishers.</p>

              <p>LION defines sustainability as the intersection of operational resilience, financial health and journalistic impact.  </p>

              <p>“Operational resilience: Without a company culture and systems, processes and policies designed to support staff and manage growth, news businesses will experience burnout among the very people whose talent and buy-in are critical to their success,” the definition states.</p>

              <p>Absolutely feel free to explore and try new things and push your comfort limit, but be sure to ask detailed questions about jobs with varied responsibilities. </p>

              <p>Showing up prepared means two different things: Make sure you’ve done your research on the company, what it covers, who your editor would be, what three good stories were recently, etc. But it also means that you cared enough to try, and it shows. </p>

              <p>On the appearance side, it matters less about what you look like, and more that you tried. You don’t need to wear something that makes you uncomfortable — but you should make an effort to be neat, clean and professional. </p>

              <p>Across many career development professionals, we heard that about two years was the average length of an entry-level role. That isn’t a hard and fast rule, but you may outgrow the role — if you’re presented with a contract that requires you to stay more than two years, consider talking with your support group or trusted advisors.</p>

          <p>Hiring managers in local news: You’re likely wearing a lot of hats and doing a lot with very little. We know you’re likely juggling leadership at work and caretaking at home, on top of taking care of yourself. And quite often, especially in tight operations, we know that hiring can often feel like an act of triage to resolve the chaos of being understaffed.</p>
          

          <p>We hope that these tips and resources can be helpful to you as you work to build your team, especially to help you find the right fit. </p>

              <p>Think back to your first internship or job: What’s the one thing that stood out? Is it the mentors who guided you into local news, or the fabulous projects you got to work on, or maybe the other journalists who taught you as much as your editor? </p>
              <p>Newsrooms can tailor the experience to the early career journalist through one-on-one mentoring. The mentor should be able to identify the journalist’s learning style, long-term goals and challenges in order to help them grow.</p>
              <p>This isn’t only the responsibility of the mentor and/or hiring manager, but a group effort — how is your organization as a whole going to bring in this person? </p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p class="lead-quote">🗣️ "I think that orgs just need to not lose sight of the fact that every single action taken, especially around people, needs to have a DEIB lens attached to it, constantly, rigorously. It takes time, someone on staff to do it who's paid.”</p><p> — Sara Shahriari, director of leadership & talent development at Institute for Nonprofit News</p>
              <p>Doug Mitchell, the founder and project director of NPR Next Generation, said that the reporters in the program pitch their own story idea but within a framework or “theme.” Those chosen for the program will be paired 1:1 with a mentor and together, they will report and produce said story.</p>
              <p>The reporters in the cohort are usually from the same geographic area, but he finds the diversity of their lived experiences contributes to a rich range of people and places covered.</p>
              <p>This, he said, points to the benefits of a newsroom that values reporters’ lived experiences in their work and embeds DEIB principles throughout the workplace, not just during the hiring process.</p>
              <p>"When it comes to making these processes stick, you need someone at the top saying, This publicly states the priority of our organization,” <a href="https://rjionline.org/person/mary-heisey/">Mary Heisey</a>, a freelance podcast producer, broadcast radio editor and co-creator of the <a href="https://rjionline.org/news/introducing-the-youth-media-starter-guide/">Youth Media Starter Guide</a>, said. </p>
              <p>As a manager, it’s important to support employees as individuals with strengths, weaknesses and whole lives, not just what they bring to their specific job, Graham said. This is how you inspire loyalty, he said. </p>
              <p>“Companies have to demonstrate what their values are through actions, not just statements or boilerplates,” said Kelly Barnett, assistant director, people and culture, for Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p class="lead-quote">🗣️ “Explicitly state on job postings that you're encouraged to apply even if you don't meet 100% of the qualifications.”</p><p> — Mary Heisey, a freelance podcast producer, broadcast radio editor and co-creator of the Youth Media Starter Guide</p>
              <p>Carefully consider which skills, experiences and qualifications are “required” and which should be listed as “preferred.”</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/must-dos-for-writing-inclusive-job-descriptions">Studies</a> <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified">show</a> that women and applicants from underrepresented groups often only apply for jobs for which they meet all requirements. Explicitly stating that some skills can be learned on the job will encourage a wider variety of applicants, as will stating that some applicants may bring unstated skills and experiences to the position. </p>
              <p>“I think it would be a great idea for a newsroom (that’s) interested in doing this work to do an audit of their past job postings and ask, okay, I saw that we listed these as the requirements of the job — were they truly requirements?” Heisey said. </p>
              <p>“Don’t oversell experience or education required,” Andy Alford, director of editorial recruitment, training and career development at The Texas Tribune, said. </p>
              <p>Heisey agrees: “Rethink what counts as years of experience,” she said. “Schoolwork and volunteering are valuable exposure for journalists.”</p>
              <p>And schoolwork might not mean traditional journalism work, either. </p>
              <p>“I also think being explicitly welcoming people who are switching careers (is important) because I hear all the time from people of all ages, that they felt really discouraged if they didn't go to journalism school, or have a master's degree,” Alice Wilder, podcast producer/reporter, creator of the Starting Out newsletter, said. </p>
              <p>Of course, there will likely be concrete requirements. For example, in a senior data reporter position, you may require them to have data reporting experience. But knowing a specific data analysis language might be a preferred skill rather than a required one if you’re able to teach the tool. </p>

              <p>It’s important to consider whether job posting language about company “culture” is sending inclusive or exclusive messages. </p>
              <p>“Job posting language is meant to bring people in, not screen them out,” Heyamoto said. </p>
              <p>Importantly, this approach must go beyond recruitment. Hiring a journalist without needed skills requires the organizational capacity to teach and train on the job. The resources required to do this well should be factored into the budget. Similarly, calling your company culture “collaborative” in a job posting is only helpful when the work is collaborative.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, the organization risks setting up new hires for failure in the position. </p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p class="lead-quote">🗣️ "Unpaid internships are not going to get a lot of traction because there are enough that are paid that the students would rather go and do something for pay."</p><p> - Emily Hughes Corio, journalism & media program chair, teaching professor and internship coordinator at West Virginia University</p>
              <p><strong>The debate over unpaid internships in journalism is over. </strong></p>
              <p>If you can’t fund a 40-hour-per-week internship position, consider a part-time role with a robust hourly rate. Or pay college students as freelancers rather than interns. Work with your local college or university about a potential partnership to unlock scholarship money and consider working with national partners, such as <a href="https://scripps.com/fund/journalism/fellowships-and-internships/">EW Scripps</a> or <a href="https://dowjonesnewsfund.org/">Dow Jones News Fund</a>.</p>
              <p>“I also firmly believe internships have to be paid because if you expect somebody to come work for you for the whole summer for free, where they've got to pay rent, you are taking a lot of people out of the picture who aren’t able to do that,” Sherry Chisenhall, retired editor & president of Charlotte Observer, said. </p>
              <p>For-credit internships are generally not an option because students must pay tuition to receive credit. Instead, top internship and fellowship programs emphasizing equity should work to provide housing and moving assistance in addition to pay.</p>

              <p>Alford said taking a multipronged approach has worked best for her, including campus visits, especially to HBCUs and Hispanic-serving institutions, as well as annual career fairs and conferences. Making these routine creates opportunities to nurture deeper relationships.</p>
              <p>As an example, you may like a candidate who just isn’t a fit for the opening you have. By maintaining that relationship, you’ll have a better sense of when that candidate is ready for an opening down the line.</p>
              <p>Retention is often a bigger challenge than hiring in terms of building a diverse workforce, Graham said. In other words, how and why did the previous employee leave? What support may be needed for the new candidate to be successful? </p>

              <p>“I try to practice a three-person hiring rule — having at least three people, from other departments when feasible, have their own conversations with the candidate,” Horner said. “That gives additional perspective about the prospective hire and gives me additional insight in my decision-making.”</p>
              <p>This might be the first time the candidates have experienced your organization: Who will they see? </p>
              <p>Consider utilizing readers on a volunteer basis, opening up your hiring process to more of your staff or creating intentional time in the interview process to discuss your vision and why you’re trying to diversify your staff. </p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p class="lead-quote">🗣️  “Hiring shouldn’t be done in your spare time. Have a timeline and tell candidates what it is.”</p><p> — Lisa Heyamoto, programming director, membership education, LION Publishers</p>
              <p>Your organization’s hiring timeline could be very quick or extremely slow. Candidates won’t know what’s typical for your organization.</p>
              <p>Graham said that hiring can be one of the most demoralizing experiences a person goes through. For the sake of your candidates, give them a concrete timeline, starting with dates in the job listing itself, and transparency and accountability throughout the process.</p>
              <p>For example, hold yourself accountable by listing the week of first interviews on the job description; after folks apply, send an automated email thanking the candidate for their application and listing the milestone dates for the rest of the hiring process, including polite rejection emails if possible. If circumstances derail the timeline, be transparent about changes.</p>
              <p>This creates a better experience for all candidates, especially those without a lot of timeline flexibility. It can also help retain candidates who would otherwise withdraw from with a long process. (If you’re in academia, this might want to be something to strongly consider.) </p>
              <p>“Be considerate of the time you're asking of candidates,” Komp said. “If you can make the process smoother, you will attract a larger and more diverse candidate pool."</p>

      <h2>Our Methodology for the project</h2>
      

        <p>In order to get a sense of better practices in hiring across local news, we created a list of professionals in four categories — recruiting, student media, talent development and career services. </p>

        <p>We knew we wanted a larger sample size for these interviews, with multiple folks conducting these interviews using standardized questions. </p>

        <p>We looked for professionals doing work in fellowships in well-known places such as Reynolds Journalism Institute, JSK Fellowships, Nieman Fellowships and more. We searched industry publications archives in Nieman Labs and Columbia Journalism Review to find more. </p>

        <p>For less widely publicized roles such as career services counselors, we looked first for professionals who worked in journalism-specific schools rather than in a general career services role. We wanted the widest possible variety in experiences, reaching out to folks in community colleges, historically Black colleges and universities, public four-year and private universities. </p>

        <p>For recruiters, we tried to get a variety of sources from both corporate-led and more independent news organizations, including folks who are now teaching after years of recruitment. We also tried to diversify perspectives on recruitment by media type.</p>

        <p>For talent development professionals, we reached out to folks who are leading fellowship and internship programs that bring early career journalists into the field, or folks who are creating content that informs early career journalists on how to enter the field.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, for the first round of interviews, we found that folks closer to our networks were more likely to respond, hence the large proportion of respondents from NC and the Southeast. We hope to further expand this network in future rounds of reporting. </p>
